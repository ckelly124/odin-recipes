    <p><strong><u>Ingredients</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mature starter</li>
        <li>700 grams high-quality white bread flour, plus more for feeding starter and dusting work surfaces</li>
        <li>300 grams high-quality whole-wheat flour, whole-grain rye flour, or spelt flour, or a combination</li>
        <li>20 grams kosher salt or fine sea salt</li>
        <li>Rice flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>¼ cup (60 g) sliced jalapeños (pickled or fresh)</li>
        <li>4 oz. (113 g) sharp cheddar cheese (shredded)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>Instructions</u></strong></p>
    <p>Day One: Prepare Starter</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Feed your starter (refreshing) in the morning.</li>
        <li> Cover the container, and let sit at room temperature for 10-12 hours</li>
        <li>Feed your starter a second time the evening before you bake</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Day Two: Mix and Rest your Dough</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together flour and water and let sit (autolyse) between 30 minutes to 2 hours</li>
        <li>Make sure the starter is ready to use (perform a float test)</li>
        <li>Combine the autolyse and 200 grams of starter.</li>
        <li>Add 20 grams of salt and 20 grams of water, then incorporate. Let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slap and fold with wet hands for 10 minutes</li>
        <li> Check if the dough has built enough gluten (perform the windowpane test). If the dough tears before this point, continue to mix and check again every 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use a flexible bench scraper to scrape dough out onto a clean surface. Rinse the bowl to remove any dried flour, then return the dough to the damp bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let rest for 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Perform 3 sets of stretch and folds, 30 minutes apart, over the next hour and a half. Let rest until the dough doubles in size</li>
        <li>During the second set of stretch and folds, incorporate the shredded cheese and jalapenoes into the dough</li>
        <li>Clear and lightly flour a work surface. Gently turn out the dough, letting its weight coax it out of the bowl and loosening the sides with the bench scraper. Divide the dough in half with the bench scraper.</li>
        <li>Using floured hands and working with one piece of dough at a time, gently pull all the edges of the dough toward the center to create a round, tidy packet. (The non-floured surface will readily stick to itself.) Use a bench scraper to turn the loose ball of dough over so it rests seam-side down. Cover with a clean towel and repeat with the second half of dough. Let both pieces of dough rest, covered, on the work surface for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>As dough rests, line two baskets or mixing bowls with clean kitchen towels. Stir together a 50/50 mixture of white bread flour and rice flour. (Rice flour will prevent sticking.) Dust the interiors of the baskets generously with the 50/50 flour mixture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough a last time (final shaping). Uncover one piece of dough and lightly dust the top with the 50/50 flour mixture. In one decisive motion, use the bench scraper to lift and turn the dough over floured-side down. Slide your fingertips beneath the dough and stretch it gently into a square shape. Fold the left side of the dough inward toward the center, then fold the right side inward and overtop of the left fold. Starting at the end closest to you, roll the dough away from you into a bulky spiral. Let the dough sit for a minute or two on its seam to help it seal, then use a bench scraper to lift up the dough and place it seam-side up in one of the prepared baskets. Lightly dust the exposed part of the dough with more of the 50/50 flour mixture, and cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat with the second piece of dough.</li>
        <li> Rest loaves at room temperature, checking on them periodically, until the surface of the dough has settled and the entire loaves have slightly increased in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Press a floured finger about 1/2 inch into the dough. If the dough springs back immediately, it needs more time — check again every 20 minutes. But, if it springs back slowly and a slight impression remains, the dough is proofed.</li>
        <li>Once the dough passes the poke test, cover the baskets with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator. Chill overnight and up to two days before baking. The longer the dough spends in the refrigerator, the tangier the final bread will taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Day Three: Baking Day!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>About an hour before baking, arrange a rack in the lower third of your oven and place a large, uncovered Dutch oven inside. Heat the oven to 500 degrees</li>
        <li>Remove one loaf from the refrigerator and uncover. Lightly dust the exposed dough with the 50/50 flour mixture, massaging it into the surface. Place a piece of parchment paper over the basket, making sure the parchment is longer and wider than the basket by several inches. Invert the loaf onto the parchment paper. Remove the basket, then slowly peel away the towel. Dust the rounded side of the dough with more of the 50/50 flour mixture, rubbing it into the surface to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Use a lame or a serrated knife to make a long, slightly off-center slash about 1/4-inch deep, angling the blade toward the midline of the loaf.</li>
        <li>Very carefully place the heated Dutch oven on the stovetop. Taking care not to touch the sides, use the parchment paper to lower the loaf into the Dutch oven. Cover and return it to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes. Then, carefully remove the lid and reduce the oven temperature to 450 degrees. Continue to bake the loaf uncovered until the surface is deeply browned all over, another 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the Dutch oven from the oven, and use tongs to help you pull out the loaf. Transfer the Dutch oven back to the oven, and set the oven temperature back to 500 degrees. Repeat the process with the second loaf of bread.</li>
        <li>Allow the loaves to cool completely, for a few hours, before cutting into them. Whole loaves can be stored uncovered at room temperature for 1 day. Once cut, bread should be stored in paper bags at room temperature and will keep for 5 days or longer. After the second day, it benefits from light toasting.</li>
